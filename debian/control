Description: Probably the simplest and fastest audio player for Linux.
 Pogo plays your music. Nothing else. It is both fast and easy-to-use. The clear
 interface uses the screen real-estate very efficiently. Other features include:
 Fast search on the harddrive and in the playlist, smart album grouping, cover
 display, desktop notifications and no music library.
 Pogo is a fork of Decibel Audio Player and supports most common audio formats.
 It is written in Python and uses GTK+ and gstreamer.
