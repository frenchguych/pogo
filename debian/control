Description: Pogo is a simple and fast audio player for Linux.
 Its clean interface makes Pogo a perfect fit for small screens.
 Other features include: Fast search on the harddrive and in the
 playlist, smart album grouping, cover display, desktop notifications
 and the lack of a music library. Pogo is a fork of Decibel Audio
 Player and supports most common audio formats. It is written in Python
 and uses GTK+ and GStreamer.
