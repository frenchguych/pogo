Description: Pogo is probably the simplest and fastest audio player for Linux. 
 Its elementary-inspired design uses the screen-space very efficiently. 
 Pogo is especially well-suited for people who organize their music by albums on the harddrive. 
 The main interface components are a directory tree and a playlist that groups albums in an innovative way.
