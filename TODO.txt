=== Roadmap ===

O Search whole system by default (after "locate" finishes)
O Add application-wide message system for warnings. Should use event system.
O Show warning if search commands fail.
O Use new logo by Kevin Macphail
O Port from PyGTK 2 to PyGI GTK 3
  O Make sure pygobject doesn't make us slower
  O Wait for pygobject to stabilize
    (version 3.12 causes too many segfaults and X errors)
  X GStreamer: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Novacut/GStreamer1.0
O Port from python2 to python3 (needs PyGI and mutagen 1.25).
  Make unicode handling in GTK easier.


=== Features that will MAYBE be implemented ===

O Stop after current album / track (Playlist context menu entry)
O Enqueue
O Party View (Fullscreen)
O Scrobbling Support (using decibel code)
O Shuffle
O Repeat
O Playlist loading
O Sound Indicator for the Ubuntu Sound Menu
  (Use new unity API for SoundMenu (https://launchpad.net/hello-unity))
  (needs gtk3)


=== Features that will NOT be implemented ===

- Do not add empty dirs to Tracktree (Irritating)
- Ellipsize names (Looks odd)
- Play audio CDs (Rip and play is nicer anyways)
- Use multiprocessing for searching (Too error prone)
- Check if using nautilus uri:///path/to/file works and selects a file
  Only works in GTK 3.1 probably (does not work in GTK 3.3)
- Crossfading (too tedious in gstreamer)
- Lyrics (KISS)
