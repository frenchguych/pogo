 Pogo - A simple audio player
========================================================================
Pogo is probably the simplest and fastest audio player for Linux. 
Its elementary-inspired design uses the screen-space very efficiently. 
Pogo is especially well-suited for people who organize their music by 
albums on the harddrive. The main interface components are a directory 
tree and a playlist that groups albums in an innovative way.

Supported file formats include Ogg Vorbis, MP3, FLAC, Musepack,
Wavpack, and MPEG-4 AAC.

Pogo is written by Jendrik Seipp (jendrikseipp@web.de). 
It is a fork of Decibel Audio Player.

 Requirements
====================

Pogo depends on the Python runtime and the following libraries: 

    * Python (>= 2.5):      http://www.python.org
    * PyGTK (>= 2.12):      http://www.pygtk.org
    * PyGST (>= 0.10.2):    http://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/
    * Mutagen (>= 1.10):    http://code.google.com/p/mutagen/
    * Python DBus:          http://dbus.freedesktop.org/
    * Python Imaging (PIL): http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/

Particular audio formats depend on various GStreamer decoding elements, 
as well as other Python modules. GStreamer splits their downlads into 
good, bad, ugly, and ffmpeg packages, each of which contains elements; 
you probably want them all.
