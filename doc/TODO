=== Roadmap ===

0.x:
X Show search results immediately after they're found for each music directory
X Search in playlist as well and highlight results
O Use new logo by Kevin Macphail
O Stop after current album / track (Playlist context menu entry)
O Remember last played track (LP:684383)
O Shuffle
O Repeat
O Playlist loading (Only add tracks in playlist not added anyways)
O Add Zeitgeist module (check rhythmbox and banshee first)
O Sound Indicator for the Ubuntu Sound Menu
  (https://github.com/sunng87/Exaile-Soundmenu-Indicator,
   http://theravingrick.blogspot.com/2011/02/easily-support-sound-menu-in-python.html)
O Convert GUI from libglade to gtkbuilder (apply fix from decibel)


=== Features that will MAYBE be implemented ===
O Enqueue?
O Party View (Fullscreen)?
O Scrobbling Support (using decibel code)?
O Lyrics?


=== Features that will NOT be implemented ===
- Do not add empty dirs to Tracktree (Irritating)
- Ellipsize names (Looks odd)
- Play audio CDs (Rip and play is nicer anyways)
- Use multiprocessing for searching (Too error prone)
- Search tracks with locate and add all results before searching with find
  (Search is already fast enough)
- Check if using nautilus uri:///path/to/file works and selects a file
  Only works in GTK 3.1 probably (does not work in GTK 3.3)
