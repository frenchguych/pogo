=== Roadmap ===

0.5:
X Export tracks in playlist into a directory (with subdirectories)
X Save playlist periodically to prevent losing it during a shutdown (LP:669132)
X Usability: Select new track when old selected is deleted
X Fix: Playback after pause should show the play icon, not the pause icon
O Fix: When a track is playing and a directory is appended in nautilus,
  playback sometimes skips to new tracks
O Use new logo by Kevin Macphail
X Cache music folders repeatedly to speedup searches
X Let user remove music folders that were deleted from the hard disk
O Do not add music folders that have been deleted

0.x:
O Stop after current album / track (Playlist context menu entry)
O Remember last played track (LP:684383)
O Shuffle
O Repeat
O Playlist loading (Only add tracks in playlist not added anyways)
O Add Zeitgeist module (check rhythmbox and banshee first)
O Sound Indicator (https://github.com/sunng87/Exaile-Soundmenu-Indicator,
  http://theravingrick.blogspot.com/2011/02/easily-support-sound-menu-in-python.html)
O Playlist filtering
O Check if using nautilus uri:///path/to/file works and selects a file
  Only works in GTK 3.1 probably


=== Features that will MAYBE be implemented ===
O Enqueue?
O Party View (Fullscreen)?
O Scrobbling Support (using decibel code)?
O Lyrics?


=== Features that will NOT be implemented ===
- Do not add empty dirs to Tracktree (Irritating)
- Ellipsize names (Looks odd)
- Play audio CDs (Rip and play is nicer anyways)
- Use multiprocessing for searching (Too error prone)
