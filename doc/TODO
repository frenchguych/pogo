=== Roadmap ===

0.3:
X Search for tracks in the music folders
X Let users add and hide directories in file browser
O Add "Open containing folder" context menu item
X Highlight found occurences for searches with non-ASCII characters too
X Show status messages when searching
X Fix Loading files from commandline (make paths absolute)
X Fix: Save playlist also when files have been added on the commandline

0.x:
O Stop after current album / track
O Save playlist periodically to prevent losing it during a shutdown
O Export playlist to .m3u format
O Shuffle
O Repeat
O Playlist loading (Only add tracks in pl not added anyways)
O Add Zeitgeist module
O Sound Indicator


0.y:
O Enqueue?
O Party View?
O Scrobbling Support?
O Lyrics?


=== Features that will not be implemented ===
- Do not add empty dirs to Tracktree (Irritating)
- Ellipsize names (Looks odd)
- Play audio CDs (Rip and play is nicer anyways)
