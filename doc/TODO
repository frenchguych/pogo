=== Roadmap ===

X Control pogo from the commandline. The commands play, pause, next, prev and stop are supported. (lp:986164)
O Use new logo by Kevin Macphail
O Stop after current album / track (Playlist context menu entry)
O Playlist loading (Only add tracks in playlist not added as normal files at the same time)
O Sound Indicator for the Ubuntu Sound Menu
  (https://github.com/sunng87/Exaile-Soundmenu-Indicator,
   http://theravingrick.blogspot.com/2011/02/easily-support-sound-menu-in-python.html,
   https://launchpad.net/hello-unity)
O Port from gtk2 to gtk3 (Make sure pygobject doesn't make us slower, wait for pygobject
                          to stabilize and spread to distros more)
  O Use new unity API for SoundMenu
O Port from python2 to python3
  O Use hsaudiotag3k if mutagen is still not python3 compatible. This should also give a 3x speedup.
    We should probably write our own faster version of auto.File()


=== Features that will MAYBE be implemented ===
O Enqueue
O Party View (Fullscreen)
O Scrobbling Support (using decibel code)
O Shuffle
O Repeat


=== Features that will NOT be implemented ===
- Do not add empty dirs to Tracktree (Irritating)
- Ellipsize names (Looks odd)
- Play audio CDs (Rip and play is nicer anyways)
- Use multiprocessing for searching (Too error prone)
- Check if using nautilus uri:///path/to/file works and selects a file
  Only works in GTK 3.1 probably (does not work in GTK 3.3)
- Crossfading (too tedious in gstreamer)
- Lyrics (KISS)
