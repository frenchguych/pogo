=== Roadmap ===

X Convert GUI from libglade to gtkbuilder.
X Search in home folder if we haven't found anything in the music directories.
X Do not search in subdirectories if we already search in parent directory.
O Use new logo by Kevin Macphail
O Search for tracks in all directories (not just music directories) with locate.
  Report only hits outside the music directories.
O Stop after current album / track (Playlist context menu entry)
O Playlist loading (Only add tracks in playlist not added as normal files at the same time)
O Sound Indicator for the Ubuntu Sound Menu
  (https://github.com/sunng87/Exaile-Soundmenu-Indicator,

O Port from gtk2 to gtk3 (Make sure pygobject doesn't make us slower)
O Port from python2 to python3


=== Features that will MAYBE be implemented ===
O Enqueue
O Party View (Fullscreen)
O Scrobbling Support (using decibel code)
O Shuffle
O Repeat


=== Features that will NOT be implemented ===
- Do not add empty dirs to Tracktree (Irritating)
- Ellipsize names (Looks odd)
- Play audio CDs (Rip and play is nicer anyways)
- Use multiprocessing for searching (Too error prone)
- Check if using nautilus uri:///path/to/file works and selects a file
  Only works in GTK 3.1 probably (does not work in GTK 3.3)
- Crossfading (too tedious in gstreamer)
- Lyrics (KISS)
