=== Roadmap ===

0.4:
O Stop after current album / track (Playlist context menu entry)
O When track is added from nautilus etc. start track if not already playing
O Use multiprocessing for searching
O Stop search, when user clears field or enters new search phrase
O Add search shortcut

0.x:
O Save playlist periodically to prevent losing it during a shutdown
O Export playlist to .m3u format
O Export tracks in playlist into a directory
O Shuffle
O Repeat
O Playlist loading (Only add tracks in playlist not added anyways)
O Add Zeitgeist module (check rhythmbox and banshee first)
O Sound Indicator (https://github.com/sunng87/Exaile-Soundmenu-Indicator)


=== Features that will MAYBE be implemented ===
O Enqueue?
O Party View (Fullscreen)?
O Scrobbling Support (using decibel code)?
O Lyrics?


=== Features that will NOT be implemented ===
- Do not add empty dirs to Tracktree (Irritating)
- Ellipsize names (Looks odd)
- Play audio CDs (Rip and play is nicer anyways)
